/**
 * Endpoint, credential and tenant, resolved once.
 *
 * <p>Everything under {@code ai.hanzo.cloud} is generated from the API document
 * hanzoai/cloud emits, by {@code scripts/generate.sh}. This file is not: it is
 * the hand-written entry point, and the only place in the module that reads the
 * environment. It sits beside the generated package rather than inside it
 * because {@code sdks.yaml} hands the generator {@code ai/hanzo/cloud} outright
 * — a file in there is deleted by the next regeneration.
 *
 * <p>The credential itself is the GENERATED client's, not this file's. The
 * document declares a {@code bearer} security scheme and applies it to every
 * operation except the five that say {@code security: []}, so {@link ApiClient}
 * registers an {@code HttpBearerAuth} and each generated call names it; all this
 * does is hand it the token. The header goes out from
 * {@code HttpBearerAuth.applyToParams}, on the calls the document says need it
 * and not on the public ones. {@code X-Org-Id} is a default header because it is
 * a tenant selector rather than a credential: no scheme declares it and no
 * generated signature accepts it.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   ApiClient hanzo = Hanzo.client();
 *   new KeysApi(hanzo).getKeys();
